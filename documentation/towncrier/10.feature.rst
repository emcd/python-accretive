Add ``ValidatorDictionary`` and ``ProducerValidatorDictionary`` classes.
Validator dictionaries allow a validation function to be supplied, which can
inspect the key and value of a proposed dictionary entry to determine if it
should be accepted or not. Producer dictionaries are like ``defaultdict`` from
the standard Python ``collections`` module.
