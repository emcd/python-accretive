TABLE: _DictionaryProxy[ str, str ] = _DictionaryProxy( {

    'abc attributes exemption': '''
Derived from and compatible with :py:class:`abc.ABCMeta`. The
``__abstractmethods__`` class attribute and the class attributes, whose names
start with ``_abc_``, are exempt from the accretion mechanism so that the
internal method abstraction machinery can function correctly.
''',

    'class attributes accretion': '''
Prevents reassignment or deletion of class attributes after they have been
assigned. Only assignment of new class attributes is permitted.
''',

    'description of class factory class': '''
Derived from :py:class:`type`, this is a metaclass. A metaclass is a class
factory class. I.e., it is a class that produces other classes as its
instances.
''',

    'description of module': '''
Derived from :py:class:`types.ModuleType`, this class is suitable for use as a
Python module class.
''',

    'description of namespace': '''
A namespace is an object, whose attributes can be determined from iterables and
keyword arguments, at initialization time. The string representation of the
namespace object reflects its current instance attributes. Modeled after
:py:class:`types.SimpleNamespace`.
''',

    'dictionary entries accretion': '''
Prevents alteration or removal of dictionary entries after they have been
added. Only addition of new dictionary entries is permitted.
''',

    'dictionary entries production': '''
When an attempt to access a missing entry is made, then the entry is added with
a default value. Modeled after :py:class:`collections.defaultdict`.
''',

    'instance attributes accretion': '''
Prevents reassignment or deletion of instance attributes after they have been
assigned. Only assignment of new instance attributes is permitted.
''',

    'module attributes accretion': '''
Prevents reassignment or deletion of module attributes after they have been
assigned. Only assignment of new module attributes is permitted.
''',

    'subpackage behavior: attributes accretion': '''
Accretive data structures can grow at any time but can never shrink. An
accretive dictionary accepts new entires, but cannot have existing entries
altered or removed. Similarly, an accretive namespace accepts new attributes,
but cannot have existing attributes assigned to new values or deleted.
